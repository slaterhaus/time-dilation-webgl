### Three.js Gravitational Time Dilation Visualization

This project provides a visual demonstration of gravitational time dilation using Three.js. 

It simulates two cubes in orbit around a sphere. Each cube's rate of rotation and velocity change based on its proximity to the sphere, 
mimicking the effect of gravity in accordance with the principles of general relativity. 

The project incorporates the Lorentz factor from special relativity, as well as a simplified representation of gravitational time dilation. 

The GUI allows users to manipulate certain variables in the simulation and provides real-time updates on each cube's rotation count and velocity.
